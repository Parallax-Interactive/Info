## Who are we?
**Parallax Interactive** is a growing group of talented developers creating quality productions in a hobbyist environment. We are a community-driven group, with applications open to anyone. Activity and community engagement are a huge priority, so our journey is to share. Our team primarily works around the 6-month development phases, publishing story-rich games in different categories. We normally operate in hyper-realistic games targeted towards PC and Next-Generation consoles such as Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5.

Occasionally, smaller productions are moved out of the way for much larger video games. The SUBJECT series is our next big production, which we will start once we have sufficient funding, team members, and community engagement. 

## What can I do here? #
This is the most asked question we get. There is so much an individual can do. You could always become a paid member, which gives you many premium perks (https://discord.com/servers/parallax-interactive-1036739036427071498). Instead, simply being a part of our community on our Instagram or Discord is plenty! Participating in live events, giving feedback, making friends and any community action help us a ton. Of course, buying the games we make or publish helps us the most.

Additionally, you can join our team directly. More information and the interest form can be found on the Join Us page on our website (https://www.parallaxinteractive.info). Our application is very rigorous, but once you are in, the work and environment feel like a friend group, creating games as a combined hobby.
